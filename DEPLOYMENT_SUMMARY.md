## 🔄 Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline

### **Multi-Stage Quality Gate System**
1. **Pre-commit Validation (Local)**
   - Code formatting check (Prettier)
   - Linting validation (ESLint)
   - TypeScript type checking
   
2. **Pre-push Verification (Local)**
   - Complete test suite execution
   - Production build verification
   
3. **CI/CD Validation (Remote)**
   - Comprehensive quality checks
   - Environment validation
   - Build verification
   
4. **Deployment (Remote)**
   - Only executes if all validations pass
   - Automatic rollback on failure

### **Automated Deployment Workflow**
- **Production Trigger:** Push to `main` branch
- **Staging Trigger:** Push to `develop` branch
- **PR Validation:** Runs validation on all pull requests
- **Pipeline Steps:**
  1. **Validation Job:**
     - Code checkout and Node.js setup
     - Dependency installation with pnpm
     - Type checking, formatting, and linting validation
     - Test suite execution with coverage reporting
  2. **Deployment Job (only if validation passes):**
     - Environment variable configuration
     - Vercel build and deployment
     - Deployment verification
