# Implementation Plan: LLM-Powered Expense Logging and Splitting

**Goal:** To implement the remaining features for a complete LLM-powered expense splitting application, focusing on group management, expense logging with OpenAI integration, settlement calculations, and deployment.

## Implementation Context

### User & Functional Perspective
- **Problem Solved:** Simplifies group expense tracking by allowing natural language input instead of complex manual forms
- **Key Workflows:** Natural language expense entry → LLM parsing → user confirmation → expense tracking → settlement calculation
- **Core Capabilities:** Group creation, member management, LLM-powered expense parsing, manual expense entry, settlement optimization, debt simplification

### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture Fit:** Builds on existing Next.js/Supabase foundation with OpenAI integration via Edge Functions
- **Affected Components:** Adds new group management, expense processing, and settlement components
- **Data Model Changes:** Requires new Group, GroupMember, and Expense tables in Supabase

### Boundaries & Constraints
- **Out of Scope:** Payment integration, receipt OCR, multi-currency support (V1 is USD only)
- **Limitations:** English-only LLM input, offline functionality not supported
- **Unchanged Functionality:** Existing authentication system remains as-is
