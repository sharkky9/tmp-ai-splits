# Implementation Plan: Production Deployment

**Goal:** Deploy the current version of the LLM Expense Splitting Application to both local development and Vercel production environments. This plan focuses on achieving a stable deployment of the application in its *current state*. Comprehensive bug fixing, product improvements, and extensive performance optimization will be addressed in subsequent implementation plans after this initial deployment and further user testing.

## Implementation Context

### User & Functional Perspective
- **Problem Solved:** Enable live testing and user access to the expense splitting application with production-grade reliability and monitoring for its current feature set.
- **Key Workflows:** Automated deployment from git pushes, environment-specific configuration management, essential performance monitoring, and error tracking for deployment stability.
- **Core Capabilities:** Local development environment, staging deployment, production deployment with essential monitoring for the current application version, automated CI/CD pipeline, and foundational error tracking.

### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture Fit:** Builds upon the existing completed application with production infrastructure, monitoring, and deployment automation.
- **Affected Components:** Environment configuration, database setup, Edge Functions deployment, frontend deployment, monitoring integration.
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel for frontend/API routes, Supabase for database/Edge Functions, Sentry for error monitoring, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Boundaries & Constraints
- **Out of Scope:** Feature changes to the application code beyond what is already implemented, major architectural modifications beyond what is necessary for deployment, enterprise-scale infrastructure, comprehensive bug fixing of all known issues beyond deployment blockers, and implementation of new product improvements. These will be handled in subsequent plans.
- **Limitations:** Prototype scale (<1000 users), free/starter tiers for monitoring services, standard security policies. The immediate focus is on a functional deployment of the *current version* rather than exhaustive feature parity with a theoretically complete product.
- **Unchanged Functionality:** All existing application features and user workflows remain identical.

- `supabase/config.toml` - **MODIFY** - Production environment configuration
- `README.md` - **MODIFY** - Add deployment and setup instructions
- `package.json` - **MODIFY** - Add deployment scripts and monitoring dependencies

## Core Documents Affected

- `architecture.mdc` - Update with production deployment architecture and monitoring patterns (Step 2)
- `tech-stack.mdc` - Add deployment tools, monitoring services, and CI/CD tooling (Step 1)
- `design.mdc` - No changes needed for deployment

## Success Metrics
- **Deployment Success**: Both local and production environments fully functional with the current application codebase.
- **Basic Operational Stability**: Deployed application is stable and core workflows (e.g., user registration, group creation, expense logging, settlement calculation) are operational as per their current implementation.
- **Essential Monitoring Coverage**: Basic error capture and performance metrics tracking active to ensure deployment stability and identify critical post-deployment issues.
- **Uptime**: Target 99% availability for the initial production deployment.
- **Security**: All environment variables secured, RLS policies active for core data protection.
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployments working with <10 minute deploy time for the current codebase.

## Step 0: Test Scaffolding and Verification
*   **Goal:** Verify the current application state and create deployment verification tests.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Current State Verification:** Run full test suite to confirm 47/47 tests passing
    2.  **Build Verification:** Ensure production build succeeds without errors
    3.  **Environment Test Stubs:** Create deployment verification tests in `src/lib/__tests__/deployment.test.ts`:
        *   `test_local_environment_variables_loaded()`
        *   `test_production_build_succeeds()`
        *   `test_database_connectivity_local()`

        *   `test_error_tracking_functional()`
*   **Validation:**
    *   All existing tests pass (47/47)
    *   Production build completes successfully
    *   New deployment test stubs are failing (as expected)
*   **Risks:**
    *   Recent changes might have introduced regressions not caught by existing tests

    *   Local environment variables properly loaded and functional
    *   All service accounts created and accessible
    *   Deployment tools installed and authenticated
    *   Environment loading test passes
*   **Risks:**
    *   Vercel account creation might require payment method for production features
    *   Sentry free tier limits might be insufficient for prototype usage
    *   Environment variable exposure in CI/CD configuration
*   **Core Document Updates:** `tech-stack.mdc` (add Vercel, Sentry, deployment tooling).
*   **Progress:** ✅ Completed

    *   Production Supabase project configured and migrations applied
    *   Both Edge Functions deployed and responsive in production
    *   Database performance indexes created and active
    *   RLS policies verified and securing data appropriately
    *   Production database connectivity test passes
*   **Risks:**
    *   Production database setup might expose sensitive data if RLS policies are misconfigured
    *   Edge Function deployment might fail due to dependency issues or environment mismatches

*   **Progress:** ✅ Completed

## Step 5: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (GitHub Actions)
*   **Goal:** Automate deployments of the *current application state* to Vercel using GitHub Actions for pushes to main (production) and develop (staging) branches.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Workflow Creation:** Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
        *   Define triggers for `main` and `develop` branches.
        *   Set up jobs for building and deploying the current application to Vercel.
        *   Use Vercel CLI for deployments.

        *   Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to GitHub repository secrets.
        *   Add Supabase and OpenAI production keys to Vercel environment variables (via dashboard, not in repo).
    3.  **Environment-Specific Deployment:**
        *   Configure `deploy.yml` to deploy `main` branch to production Vercel project.
        *   Configure `deploy.yml` to deploy `develop` branch to a staging/preview Vercel project/alias.

*   **Progress:** ✅ Completed (Initial pipeline structure set up, manual secret configuration and first deployment test pending by user)

## Step 6: Final Deployment Verification and Documentation
*   **Goal:** Perform final checks on the production deployment of the *current application state* and update documentation for accessing the deployed application. Extensive feature testing is deferred.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Production Smoke Test (Current Features):**

        *   Check browser console for critical errors related to deployment or core functionality.
        *   Confirm environment variables are correctly loaded in production.
    2.  **Monitoring Check:**
        *   Verify Sentry is capturing any critical errors from the smoke test.

    *   Deployment environment misconfiguration impacts user experience even for current features.
*   **Core Document Updates:** `README.md` (add deployment links and instructions).
*   **Progress:** ✅ Completed
    *   **Production URLs Verified:**
        *   **Primary Production:** https://appcode-eta.vercel.app (HTTP 200 ✅)
