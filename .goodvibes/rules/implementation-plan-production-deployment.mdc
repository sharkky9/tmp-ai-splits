# Implementation Plan: Production Deployment

**Goal:** Deploy the completed LLM Expense Splitting Application to both local development and Vercel production environments with comprehensive monitoring, security, CI/CD pipeline, and performance optimization for prototype-scale usage (<1000 users).

## Implementation Context

### User & Functional Perspective
- **Problem Solved:** Enable live testing and user access to the completed expense splitting application with production-grade reliability and monitoring.
- **Key Workflows:** Automated deployment from git pushes, environment-specific configuration management, performance monitoring, and error tracking.
- **Core Capabilities:** Local development environment, staging deployment, production deployment with monitoring, automated CI/CD pipeline, and comprehensive error tracking.

### Technical Implementation
- **Architecture Fit:** Builds upon the existing completed application with production infrastructure, monitoring, and deployment automation.
- **Affected Components:** Environment configuration, database setup, Edge Functions deployment, frontend deployment, monitoring integration.
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel for frontend/API routes, Supabase for database/Edge Functions, Sentry for error monitoring, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Boundaries & Constraints
- **Out of Scope:** Feature changes to the application code, major architectural modifications, enterprise-scale infrastructure.
- **Limitations:** Prototype scale (<1000 users), free/starter tiers for monitoring services, standard security policies.
- **Unchanged Functionality:** All existing application features and user workflows remain identical.
