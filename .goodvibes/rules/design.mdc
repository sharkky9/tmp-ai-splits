# Design Guidelines

## 1. Target User Experience

The primary goal is to provide a **simple, intuitive, and fast** way for users to log and settle group expenses. The design should minimize friction and cognitive load, especially for users who may not be tech-savvy. Transparency regarding LLM actions is key, with clear fallback options when automation fails.

## 2. User Stories & Goals

### Core User Stories (from PRD)
*   **US1**: Trip organizer logging expenses with participant specification
*   **US2**: Automatic placeholder member creation for mentioned names
*   **US3**: Review and confirm LLM interpretations with visible assumptions
*   **US4**: Simple, non-technical interface for expense confirmation/adjustment
*   **US5**: Multiple group management (e.g., "Apartment Bills", "Weekend Trip")
*   **US6**: Email-based member invitations and association
*   **US7**: Clear settlement summary with minimal transaction count
*   **US8**: Clarifying questions for ambiguous input instead of guessing
*   **US9**: Multiple payers for single expense support
*   **US10**: Itemized expenses with per-item splits
*   **US11**: Manual editing/deletion and traditional form-based entry
*   **US12**: USD default currency assumption

### Success Metrics
*   LLM correction rate < 20% (target from PRD)
*   Average expense logging time < 30 seconds
*   Settlement completion rate > 80%
*   User satisfaction rating > 4.5/5 for LLM feature

## 3. Key User Flows & UI Considerations

### 3.1. Expense Logging via LLM

#### 3.1.1. Simple Single Expense Flow
*   **Input Screen:**
    *   Prominent text area with placeholder: "Describe your expense (e.g., 'I paid $25 for lunch for me and Alice')"
    *   Group context indicator showing current group and members
    *   Submit button becomes active as user types
*   **Processing State:**
    *   Loading indicator with text "Understanding your expense..."
    *   Estimated processing time (3-5 seconds)
*   **Confirmation Screen (`ExpenseConfirmationCard.tsx`):**
    *   **Header:** Original input text in a distinct box
    *   **Parsed Details Section:**
        *   Description field (editable)
        *   Amount with currency symbol (editable)
        *   Date picker (defaults to today if not specified)
        *   Payer(s) with amounts (editable list)
        *   Participants with split details (editable)
    *   **LLM Assumptions Box:** 
        *   Light background, icon indicating AI interpretation
        *   Bullet points of assumptions made
        *   "Does this look right?" prompt
    *   **Action Buttons:**
        *   Primary: "Confirm & Save"
        *   Secondary: "Edit Details"
        *   Tertiary: "Start Over"

#### 3.1.2. Multiple Payers Flow (US9)
*   **Input Example:** "Sarah paid $50 and I paid $30 for the $80 concert tickets for both of us and Tom"
*   **Confirmation Display:**
    *   **Multiple Payers Section:**
        *   Sarah: $50.00
        *   [Current User]: $30.00
        *   Total Paid: $80.00 âœ“
    *   **Participants & Splits:**
        *   Visual breakdown showing Tom's share split between Sarah and current user
        *   Clear calculation: Tom owes $26.67 (split proportionally by payment amounts)

#### 3.1.3. Itemized Expenses Flow (US10)
*   **Input Example:** "Groceries $100 paid by me. Apples $10 for me and Eve. Milk $5 for Adam. Rest split evenly among me, Eve, Adam"
*   **Confirmation Display:**
    *   **Itemized Breakdown Section:**
        *   Item 1: Apples - $10.00 (Me: $5.00, Eve: $5.00)
        *   Item 2: Milk - $5.00 (Adam: $5.00)
        *   Item 3: Remaining groceries - $85.00 (Me: $28.33, Eve: $28.33, Adam: $28.34)
    *   **Summary:**
        *   Total: $100.00
        *   Paid by: Me ($100.00)
        *   Net amounts for each participant
    *   **Edit Options:** Add/remove items, adjust splits per item

#### 3.1.4. Clarifying Questions Flow (US8)
*   **Trigger:** LLM uncertainty (e.g., "Groceries for some of us")
*   **Clarification Dialog (`ClarifyingQuestionDialog.tsx`):**
    *   **Header:** "I need clarification"
    *   **Original Input:** Displayed prominently
    *   **Question:** Clear, specific question from LLM
    *   **Response Options:**
        *   Text input for specific answers
        *   Multiple choice buttons for common scenarios
        *   "Use manual entry instead" option
*   **After Response:** Return to normal confirmation flow with refined interpretation

#### 3.1.5. LLM Failure/Fallback Flow
*   **Error States:**
    *   API timeout: "Taking longer than expected - would you like to try manual entry?"
    *   Parse failure: "I couldn't understand that expense - let's use the manual form"
    *   Confidence too low: "I'm not confident about this interpretation"
*   **Fallback Action:** Smooth transition to `ManualExpenseForm.tsx` with input text preserved

### 3.2. Manual Expense Entry (US11)

*   **Financial Data Accessibility:**
    *   Clear currency formatting
    *   Decimal precision consistency
    *   Alternative text for visual calculations

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements (UX-Related)

*   **Performance Targets:**
    *   Page load times < 2 seconds on 3G networks
    *   LLM processing < 10 seconds with visible progress
    *   Form interactions < 100ms response time
*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   Usable on 320px width screens (mobile)
    *   Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
    *   Optimized for common mobile expense logging scenarios

## 8. Design Boundaries (Non-Goals)

*   **V1 Exclusions:**
    *   Direct payment integration (Venmo, PayPal, etc.)
    *   Receipt scanning/OCR functionality
    *   Multi-language support (English only)
    *   Advanced user roles/permissions within groups
    *   Budgeting or spending analysis features
    *   Recurring expense automation
*   **Technical Limitations:**
    *   No offline functionality (requires internet for LLM)
    *   Limited to text-based expense input (no voice)

## 9. Open Design Questions

*   **OQ1 (LLM Assumptions Detail):** Current approach shows bullet points - need user testing to validate optimal level of detail
*   **OQ2 (Low Confidence Handling):** Implementing visual confidence indicators - need to test user response to different thresholds
*   **OQ3 (User Onboarding):** Example library and progressive disclosure approach - requires user research for optimal examples
*   **Settlement Workflow:** Should "Mark as Settled" be per-transaction or all-at-once? Need to test user preferences
*   **Mobile Optimization:** Touch targets for complex itemized expense editing - may need specialized mobile interactions
