Please answer the clarification / fix request below:




Tasks:
1. Analyse the error/logs and my question.
2. Make the minimal necessary code changes (including tests if required) to resolve the issue and satisfy the validation criteria for Step [step-number].
3. Suggest how future prompts or plan wording could prevent similar failures.
4. Provide a brief code-review summary of the changes.
5. Do NOT proceed to any other step.
