**Excellent! We should now have completed `.goodvibes/rules/implementation-plan-[feature-name].mdc`. Let's wrap this up.**

Remember to use the context documents (`architecture.mdc`, `tech-stack.mdc`, `design.mdc`) and the plan itself (`.goodvibes/rules/implementation-plan-[feature-name].mdc`).

Please perform the following final actions:

1.  **Verify Plan Completion:** Check `.goodvibes/rules/implementation-plan-[feature-name].mdc`; ensure ALL steps show 'Progress: Completed'. Where necessary update the plan to ensure everything matches what was accomplished.
2.  **Assess Core Documents:** Review `architecture.mdc`, `tech-stack.mdc`, `design.mdc`. Do they reflect all changes from the completed plan?
3.  **Update Core Documents (if needed):** Make necessary updates to `architecture.mdc`, `tech-stack.mdc`, `design.mdc` for full consistency with the implemented feature.
4.  **Final Report:** Create a detailed report of the implementation and add it to the bottom of the implementation plan:
    *   All plan steps in `.goodvibes/rules/implementation-plan-[feature-name].mdc` are marked 'Completed'. If not, list any exceptions.
    *   The core documents are now consistent with the completed plan. List any updates you made in step 3, or state if no updates were needed.
    *   Any known issues or gaps. Suggestions for future work or ideas to refine the system or feature. i.e. What was not accomplished.
5.  **Archive Plan**: Move `.goodvibes/rules/implementation-plan-[feature-name].mdc` to `.goodvibes/archive`

**Your thoroughness in this final report is key as it is the lasting mark of your work. Great job on reaching this point!**
