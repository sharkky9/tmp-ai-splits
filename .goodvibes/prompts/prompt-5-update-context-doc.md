Based on our previous discussion, please update the context documents including: `.goodvibes/rules/architecture.mdc`, `.goodvibes/rules/design.mdc`, and `.goodvibes/rules/tech-stack.mdc`. 

Use `.goodvibes/rules/good-vibes.mdc` to understand the contents that belong in each type of document.

Consider any changes made as a part of an implementation plan that may not be reflected in those documents, changes made based on my instructions.

Ensure the changes are integrated clearly and maintain the existing format and content of the document.
